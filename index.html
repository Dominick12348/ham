    <div class="box"> <img src="https://thatsthewayoftheworldstageplay.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/ElijahMcCoy.jpg"> <p>Elijah McCoy was born in 1844 in Colchester, Ontario, to George and Mildred Goins McCoy. At the time, they were fugitive slaves who had escaped from Kentucky to Ontario via helpers through the Underground Railroad. George and Mildred arrived in Colchester Township, Essex County, in what was then called Upper Canada in 1837 via Detroit. Elijah McCoy had eleven siblings. Ten of the children were born in Ontario from Alfred (1836) to William (1859)</p></div>
    <div class="box"> <img src="https://tuntimo.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Elijah-McCoy-1152x1536.png"> <p>When Elijah McCoy arrived in Michigan, he could find work only as a fireman and oiler at the Michigan Central Railroad. In a home-based machine shop in Ypsilanti, McCoy also did more highly skilled work, such as developing improvements and inventions. He invented an automatic lubricator for oiling the steam engines of locomotives and ships, patenting it in 1872 as "Improvement in Lubricators for Steam-Engines" (U.S. Patent 129,843).</p></div>
    <div class="box"> <img src="https://www.inventorsdigest.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/USPTO-TradingCard-ElijahJMcCoy.jpeg" alt=""> <p>McCoy married for the second time in 1873 to Mary Eleanora Delaney. The couple moved to Detroit when McCoy found work there. Mary McCoy (died 1923) helped found the Phillis Wheatley Home for Aged Colored Men in 1898. Elijah McCoy died in the Eloise Infirmary in Nankin Township, now Westland, Michigan, on 10 October 1929, at the age of 85, as a result of injuries suffered in a car accident seven years earlier in which his wife Mary died.</p></div>
